note right of WorkerController
	The WorkerController manages and controls the worker of exactly one config. The config chain is not handled by the WorkerController.

	**used patterns:**
	- [Command Pattern, Command Queue] To queue invoked commands and execute them in the controller thread or delegate to worker thread.
	- [Singleton] Allow only one instance per config.
	- [Active Object] Run methods / commands in a separate thread (controllerThread).
end note

The color coding is used to indicate in which thread a function is executed.
